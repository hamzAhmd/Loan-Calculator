# Loan Calculator Build with Vanilla JavaScript

The project is built from the inspiration taken from the Udemy JavaScript Course of @bradtraversy. The project is hosted on the surge domain:

Loan-Calculator-JS.surge.sh

## How I build this project

### Step-1

Completed the UI with the help bootstrap 4 and created the Git Repository

### Step-2

Added all the calculations in the app.js file by using the html elements of form

### Step-3

Error handling added by creating an element in javascript to display an error whenever the calulate button is pressed without values or zero entity

### Step-4

Loader gif added just to show UX design whenever the Calculate button is pressed
